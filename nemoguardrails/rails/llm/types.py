"""Structural typing contracts for the extracted ``rails.llm`` helper modules.

``LLMRails`` is decomposed into focused helper modules (``startup``, ``runtime``,
``conversation``, ``generation``, ``streaming``, ``checks``). Each helper depends
on only a narrow slice of the ``LLMRails`` instance.

This module expresses those slices along two axes:

* **Capabilities** (``Has*`` / ``Supports*``): one single-role Protocol per
  member-or-method an extracted helper touches, declared exactly once.
* **Contexts**: one Protocol per helper role, assembled by composing the
  capabilities it needs (Protocol multiple inheritance), covering exactly what
  that helper reads/writes/calls and nothing more.

These are deliberately **structural**, not pinned to the concrete ``RailsConfig``
/ ``Runtime`` / ``ExplainInfo`` classes: a helper unit treats ``config`` and
``runtime`` as opaque collaborators, so a lightweight stand-in (a
``SimpleNamespace`` config, a minimal fake runtime) that is valid for the unit
also satisfies its protocol. The concrete types are enforced at the production
call site (``LLMRails``), where ``config`` and ``runtime`` are already statically
typed.

Variance is deliberate. A member a helper *reassigns* (``rails.x = ...``) is a
plain attribute annotation (``x: Any``); ``Any`` keeps the invariant-attribute
match permissive. A member a helper only *reads* is a read-only ``@property`` so
it is covariant: a concrete attribute, a ``property``, or a fake all satisfy it,
which a mutable (invariant) attribute annotation would reject.
